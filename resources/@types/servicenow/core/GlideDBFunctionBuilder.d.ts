 * Build functions to perform SQL operations in the database.

 The GlideDBFunctionBuilder methods provide a way to build Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) functions to perform SQL operations on record data. These methods can be used in both scoped and global server scripts.

 To use platform functions:
 - Construct a function using the GlideDBFunctionBuilder constructor and associated methods.
 - After building a function, you can apply the function to the current record using the addFunction() method of the GlideRecord class.
 - Add the function to a query using the addQuery() method of the GlideRecord class.
 - Retrieve the results of the function using the existing GlideRecord API methods such as getValue() and getElement().
